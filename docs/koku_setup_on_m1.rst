=====================
Koku Setup on M1 Mac
=====================

About
-----

This documentation is to guide M1 Mac users on how to successfully install and run Koku on their machines.

Generally, in order to run Intel-based packages and programs on Mac with Apple silicon processors (M1), one can make `use of Rosetta`_ which simulates the Intel environment.

However, as for running Koku on M1 Macs we can follow the general development documentation with a few modifications as shown below.

Development
-----------

From the current list of packages used by Koku, only ``confluent-kafka`` has no support on M1 Mac, but we can install it through ``brew`` with a few modifications.

1. Install ``librdkafka`` through ``brew``: ::

    brew install librdkafka

2. Add the following line into ``~/.zshrc`` and run ``source ~/.zshrc``. *Note:* Replace ``<version>`` with the version of librdkafka you installed above: ::

    C_INCLUDE_PATH=/opt/homebrew/Cellar/librdkafka/<version>/include LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/homebrew/Cellar/librdkafka/<version>/lib pip3 install confluent_kafka

After compoleting these steps, you should be able to follow the development on `Koku's README`_. Make sure to install the versions of Docker and Homebrew that are made for M1 Macs.

Developing with Docker
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Alternatively, if you want to run the project in Docker environment, follow the below steps:

1. Set ``compose_file`` in your ``.env`` file to point to docker-compose-m1.yml_ file specially created for M1 Mac: ::

    compose_file='testing/compose_files/docker-compose-m1.yml'

2. docker-compose-m1.yml_ removes the use of ``watchdog`` package as at the time of creating this documentation, `watchdog` package is not supported on M1.
   Instead, we use a VSCode extension to run a `bash script`_ on Save in order to re-build docker containers.
   From VSCode Extensions, install `emeraldwalk.RunOnSave` and add the following to `settings.json`. More on `Run on Save`_: ::

    {
        ...
        "emeraldwalk.runonsave": {
            "commands": [
                {
                    "cmd": "bash <path-to-project>/koku/dev/scripts/m1_refresher.sh"
                }
            ]
        }
    }

Once these steps are completed, follow the instructions on `Developing with docker-compose`_.
