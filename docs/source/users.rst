User Management
===============

This section covers the customer owner, adding and removing users, email on-boarding and user preferences.

Definitions
-----------
Project Koku uses terminology in certain ways to describe key concepts. These are definitions of the term based on how they work within the context of the Koku and Masu applications.

.. _customer:

Customer: An organization or entity that uses Project Koku for cost management analysis.

.. _provider:

Provider: A cloud resource provider or cloud data provider. An entity that produces cost and resource usage data. This could be a public or private cloud.

.. _user:

User - A user of the Project Koku application. Users map to an individual person or login with access to customer_ data.

User Preferences
----------------

When a user_ is created they will have default preferences. These preferences determine how currency, timezone, and locale will be displayed in the Koku UI.

The default preferences are ::

- **Currency:** USD
- **Timezone:** UTC
- **Locale:** English United States *(en_US)*

Development
-----------

Authentication for Koku is expected to be managed by an external service.  Authentication information is expected to be provided to Koku through an HTTP header - ``HTTP_X_RH_IDENTITY``.

For development purposes, if the environment variable ``DEVELOPMENT=True`` is set, Koku will authenticate using its `dev_middleware <https://github.com/project-koku/koku/blob/master/koku/koku/dev_middleware.py>`_, which bypasses authentication and authorizes any request as valid.

This is an example for making authenticated HTTP requests to the Koku API when ``DEVELOPMENT=True``. ::

   #!/bin/bash
   HOST='localhost'
   IDENTITY=$(echo '"identity":{"org_id":"20001","account_number":"10001","username":"test_customer","email":"koku-dev@example.com"}' | base64 | tr -d '\n')
   curl -g -H "HTTP_X_RH_IDENTITY: ${IDENTITY}" 'http://'${HOST}'/api/v1/reports/inventory/aws/instance-type/'
