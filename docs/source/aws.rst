# How to ingest data from AWS

Add AWS credentials to docker-compose

Docker-compose has two repeated lines:

AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=

AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=

You'll need to set those environment variables with your AWS access and secret key. And then you can call `docker-compose up`

1)  Create a Provider

Send a POST request to

`http://<your_host>:8000/api/cost-management/v1/providers/`

With the content:

Provider Resource Name:arn:aws:iam::589173575009:role/CostManagement

You should receive a 200 range response confirming that the Provider was created.

2) Trigger Masu

Send a GET request to
`http://<your_host>:5000/api/cost-management/v1/download/`
That _should_ trigger the worker to load the data into the DB. 

You may want to check the logs to see if the loading is occuring:

`docker-compose logs -f koku-server koku-worker`


koku_beat is the Celery scheduler: Periodic Tasks â€” Celery 4.3.0 documentation


If you see this error:

Provider skipped: da56f23c-100e-4158-8544-0a146a9dc64d Valid: True Backing off: True

Then check the api_providerstatus table to see what the error message is.
