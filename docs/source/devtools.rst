Developer Tools
===============

This section describes tooling and features included in Koku to assist
developers contributing to Koku.

Environment Variables
---------------------

Koku makes use of environment variables to configure features and application
capabilities.

In the repository, there is an ``.env.example`` file with sample environment
settings. The ``.env`` file is used by Django's tools as well as Koku's scripting.
It is the recommended way to configure your local development environment
settings.

This section documents environment variables that may be of interest to
developers.

``DEVELOPMENT=(True|False)`` - Enables development features. Not for production use.
``DEVELOPMENT_IDENTITY=(JSON)`` - A JSON Object representing a User

Authentication
--------------

When ``DEVELOPMENT`` is not set, Koku expects to use an external service to
handle authentication and access control for most API endpoints.

When ``DEVELOPMENT`` is set, the development middleware is
enabled. This allows passing in custom identity information into Koku for
development and testing purposes using the ``DEVELOPMENT_IDENTITY`` variable.

Example DEVELOPMENT_IDENTITY object::

    {
        "identity": {
            "account_number": "10001",
            "type": "User",
            "user": {
                "username": "user_dev",
                "email": "user_dev@foo.com",
                "is_org_admin": False
                "access": {
                    "aws.account": {
                        "read": ["1234567890AB", "234567890AB1"]
                    }
                    "azure.subscription_guid": {
                        "read": ["*"]
                    }
                    "openshift.cluster": {
                        "read": ["*"]
                    }
                    "openshift.project": {
                        "read": ["*"]
                    }
                    "openshift.node": {
                        "read": ["*"]
                    }
                }
            },
        },
        "entitlements": {"cost_management": {"is_entitled": True}},
    }

.. note:: This example is pretty-printed for readability. When setting the enviroment variable, it should be collapsed to one single line.
