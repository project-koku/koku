Adding an OCP Provider
#######################

This section describes how to configure your Openshift Container Platform (OCP) cluster to provide Koku operator metering usage data.  Configuring your OCP cluster involves configuring four setup steps. Obtaining a login token for your reporting-operator service account. Downloading our Ansible playbook and performing the setup step to configure connectivity to the OCP cluster and generate report resources. Create a cron job that will collect the operator metering usage data on an interval and send this data to our upload service. Create an OCP provider in Koku.

Dependencies
************

We require the following dependencies in order to obtain the OCP operator metering usage data.

- You must be running OCP version 3.11 or newer.
- You must `install Operator Metering <https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-metering/blob/master/Documentation/install-metering.md>`_ on your OCP cluster.
- The Operator Metering installation must `expose a route <https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-metering/blob/master/Documentation/configuring-reporting-operator.md#openshift-route>`_ for the reporting operator.
- You must install and configure the `Red Hat Insights Client <https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-insights/#getstarted>`_ on a system with network access to you OCP cluster.
- You must install `Ansible <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.7/installation_guide/intro_installation.html>`_ and the `EPEL repository <https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL#Quickstart>`_ on the system where the Red Hat Insight Client is installed.
- You must `install the OCP commandline, oc <https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.3/cli_reference/get_started_cli.html#cli-linux>`_, on the system where the Red Hat Insighs Client is installed.


Obtaining login credentials
***************************

During the installation process for Operator Metering a service account, `reporting-operator`, is created in the Operator Metering namespace. Login to your OCP cluster with a user that has access to the Operator Metering namespace (e.g. `metering`), like a sysadmin.


::

  # oc login

  # oc project metering

After logging into the cluster you can obtain the login token for the `reporting-operator` service account with the following command which will place the token into a file, `ocp_usage_token`::


  # oc serviceaccounts get-token reporting-operator > ocp_usage_token

The token for the `reporting-operator` service account does not expire, as such the token file should be placed on file system with limited access to maintain security This service account token will be used to obtain metering data on a scheduled basis using a cron job.

Download and Configure OCP Usage Collector (Korekuta)
*****************************************************
The OCP Usage Collector is an Ansible playbook wrapped in a minimal script to help provide simpler usage. The OCP Usage Collector has two phases, setup and collect. During the `setup` phase configuration is stored for connectivity to the OCP cluster and usage reports resources are created to enable the on-going collection of usage data. During the `collect` phase usage data is retrieved from the Operator Metering endpoint and compressed into a package that is uploaded for processing by Koku via the Red Hat Insights Client.


You can download this tool with your `browser <https://github.com/project-koku/korekuta/archive/master.zip>`_ or via the command line with the following command::

  # curl -LOk https://github.com/project-koku/korekuta/archive/master.zip

The OCP Usage Collector should be downloaded on the same system where the Red Hat Insights Client was installed.

Once download you can unzip the tool and open the created directory::

  # unzip master.zip

  # cd korekuta-master

In the directory you will find the `ocp_usage.sh` script, this script will be used to run both phases of the OCP Usage Collector. In order to configure the tool you need to the following information:

- OCP API endpoint (e.g. https://api.openshift-prod.mycompany.com)
- OCP `reporting-operator` token file path
- OCP Operator Metering namespace (e.g. metering)
- The URL of the route exposed for the reporting operator in the Operator Metering namespace (e.g. https://metering.metering.api.ocp.com)
- Sudo password for installing dependencies

Now you can trigger the setup of the tool providing the above data as seen in the example below::

  # ./ocp_usage.sh --setup -e OCP_API="https://api.openshift-prod.mycompany.com"  -e OCP_METERING_NAMESPACE="metering" -e OCP_TOKEN_PATH="/path/to/ocp_usage_token" -e METERING_API="https://metering.metering.api.ocp.com"

You will be prompted for your sudo password and the Ansible playbook will execute to capture the configuration information and create the usage reports on your OCP cluster. When complete you will see the following message::

    TASK [setup : Display New Cluster Identifier] **********************************
    ok: [localhost] => {
        "msg": "Use the following value, <YOUR_OCP_IDENTIFIER>, for the cluster identifier when configuring an OCP provider in Cost Management."
    }

Record the cluster identifier noted in this step. This value is also stored in a configuration file, `config.json`, located in your `~/.config/ocp_usage/` directory.

Note: The OCP Usage Collector defaults the OCP command line, oc, to exist at `/usr/bin/oc`. If the oc command line is installed in a different location then you can supply the `-e OCP_CLI=</path/to/oc>` when executing the `ocp_usage.sh` command.

Uploading data with OCP Usage Collector (Korekuta)
**************************************************
As mentioned earlier during the `collect` phase of the OCP Usage Collector usage data is retrieved from the Operator Metering endpoint and compressed into a package that is uploaded for processing by Koku via the Red Hat Insights Client. Collection of data is performed via the `ocp_usage.sh` script as follows::

  ./ocp_usage.sh --collect

The command above would perform a one time extraction of usage data based on the defined report created during the setup step above. In order to get on-going usage data this command must be run on a regular interval. Uploading the data on a regular basis will be achieved utilizing a cron job. Use the following command to edit the crontab for the user that will execute this scheduled upload::

  # crontab -u <username> -e

Note: The crontab user must have access to the file with `reporting-operator` token.

Create an entry to run the OCP Usage collector every 45 minutes::

  */45 * * * * /path/to/ocp_usage.sh
 --collect

Note: The cron user will also need sudo authority to interact with the Red Hat Insights Client. Below is an example of the addition need to the `/etc/sudoers` file to provide password-less sudo for an example user `ocpcollector`::

  ocpcollector    ALL=(ALL)    NOPASSWD: ALL

Note: The OCP Usage Collector defaults the OCP command line, oc, to exist at `/usr/bin/oc`. If the oc command line is installed in a different location then you can supply the `-e OCP_CLI=</path/to/oc>` when executing the `ocp_usage.sh` command.

Create an OCP Provider
******************************

Using the information from the steps above which included the *cluster identifier* you can create an OCP provider. Once created the cost and usage data will be processed and made viewable within the system.
