Controling Visibility of Resources
##################################

In certain cases you may not wish users to have access to all cost data, but instead only data specific to their projects or organization. Using role based access control you can limit the visibility of resources involved in cost management reports. Role based access control utilizes groups of which users are members. These groups can be associated with one or more policies. A policy associates a group with a set of roles. A role defines a permission and a set of resource definitions. By default a user who is not an account administrator will not have access to data, but instead must be granted access to resources. Account administrators can view all data without any configuration within the role based access control.

Reports involving Amazon Web Services can be scoped by usage account or its account alias. For example if an administrator has configured eight Amazon accounts (providers) specific to different organizations within the company, but only wished a user to be able to see the data associated with their organization/account; role based access control can be utilized to filter the data set to only that specific account. This can be accomplished by creating a group that encompasses the users for that organization. A role can be defined that allows "read" permission on the specified Amazon account. Lastly a policy can be created that associates the group and role. Now any user in that group will have visibility limited to just that Amazon account.

Reports involving OpenShift can be scoped by the cluster, node, and project. In order to see report data users must have visibility to a cluster. Visibility can be further limited by specifying nodes or projects. For example an administrator might have two clusters configured (one for pre-production and one for production) and they wish to expose the cost of projects deployed on these clusters to the associated development teams. Groups would be created for each development team. Roles would be created to give "read" access to each of the clusters but only the specific project. Lastly a policy would be created to associate a specific group with the role that provides them visibility to only their project.

Reports involving OpenShift running on Amazon Web Services require visibility to be setup on both the Amazon account and the OpenShift resources as described above.
