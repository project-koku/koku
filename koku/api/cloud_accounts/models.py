"""Model for Cloud Account."""
from django.db import models


class CloudAccount(models.Model):
    """
    A model representing a cloud account.

    A cloud account value should contain
    the ID of a cloud account so that other systems may allow that ID to access their
    systems for the purpose of Koku gathering data.

    In the example of AWS, a business can give priviledges to Cost Management's
    AWS account so that it can read data from that business's cost data bucket.

    See user story: #1284 https://github.com/project-koku/koku/issues/1284

    An example cloud account is
        name: AWS_ACCOUNT_ID
        value: 012345678910
        description: Cost Management's AWS Account ID
