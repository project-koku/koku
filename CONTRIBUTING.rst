Contributing to Koku
==========================

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project!

The following are a set of guidelines for contributing to Koku. These are
guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgement. Feel free to suggest changes to
this document in a pull-request.

This document uses `RFC 2119 <https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt/>`_ keywords to indicate requirement levels.

Reporting Bugs & Requesting Features
------------------------------------

We use Github Issues to track bug reports and feature requests.

When submitting a bug report, please be as detailed as possible. Include as
much of these items as you have:

  #. steps to reproduce the bug
  #. error messages with stacktraces
  #. logs
  #. any relevant configuration settings
  #. environment details

When submitting a feature request, please submit them in the form of a user
story with acceptance criteria:

  As a [user],
  I want [a thing],
  So that [some goal].

  When complete, I will be able to:

  #. [do this]
  #. [do that]
  #. [do another]

Contributing Code (Pull Requests)
---------------------------------

All code contributions MUST come in the form of a pull-request. Pull-requests
will be reviewed for a variety of criteria. This section attempts to capture as
much of that criteria as possible.


Certificate of Origin
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By contributing to this project you agree to the Developer Certificate of
Origin (DCO). This document was created by the Linux Kernel community and is a
simple statement that you, as a contributor, have the legal right to make the
contribution. See the `DCO <DCO>`_ file for details.


Readability and Style considerations
------------------------------------

In general, we believe that code is read just as much as it is executed. So,
writing readable code is just as important as writing functional code.

Pull-requests MUST follow Python style conventions (e.g. `PEP
8 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008 />`_ and `PEP
20 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020 />`_ and
conform to generally recognized best practices. Pull-requests MAY also choose
to conform to additional style guidelines, e.g. `Google's Python Style
Guide <https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html />`_.

We do use automation whenever possible to ensure a basic level of
acceptability. Pull-requests MUST pass a linter (flake8) without
errors.

We do recognize that sometimes linters can get things wrong. They are
useful tools, but they are not perfect tools. Pull-requests SHOULD pass a linter
without warnings.

Pull-requests MAY include disabling a specific linter check. If your
pull-request disables linting it MUST include a comment block detailing why
that particular check was disabled and it MUST be scoped as narrowly as
possible. i.e. Don't disable linting on an entire class or method
when disabling the check for a single statement will do.

This repository uses `pre-commit <https://pre-commit.com />`_ to check and enforce code style. It uses
`Black <https://github.com/psf/black />`_ to reformat the Python code and `Flake8 <http://flake8.pycqa.org />`_ to check it
afterwards. Other formats and text files are linted as well.

Install pre-commit hooks to your local repository by running:

```bash
$ pre-commit install
```

After that, all your commited files will be linted. If the checks donâ€™t succeed, the commit will be rejected. Please
make sure all checks pass before submitting a pull request.

Code testing considerations
---------------------------

We believe that well-tested code is a critical component to every successful
project. For this reason, all pull-requests MUST include unit test cases and
those unit tests MUST pass when run.

The unit tests SHOULD cover all of the code in the pull-request. Our goal is to
maintain at least 90% test coverage.

In general, the test cases SHOULD cover both success and failure conditions.

An attempt SHOULD be made to cover all code branches. You SHOULD also attempt
to include tests for all class and method parameters. e.g. If a method accepts
a boolean, there should be tests for when that boolean is True, False, and None.
